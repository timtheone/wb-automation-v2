      description: |
        The method returns metadata for [assembly orders](/openapi/orders-fbs#tag/FBS-Assembly-Orders/paths/~1api~1v3~1orders/get) by the list of their IDs.
        <br><br>
        You can get the list of metadata available for an assembly order in the `requiredMeta` and `optionalMeta` fields in the response of the [Get New Assembly Orders](/openapi/orders-fbs#tag/FBS-Assembly-Orders/paths/~1api~1v3~1orders~1new/get) method.
        <br><br>
        Possible metadata:
          - `imei` — [IMEI](/openapi/orders-fbs#tag/FBS-Metadata/paths/~1api~1v3~1orders~1%7BorderId%7D~1meta~1imei/put)
          - `uin` — [UIN](/openapi/orders-fbs#tag/FBS-Metadata/paths/~1api~1v3~1orders~1%7BorderId%7D~1meta~1uin/put)
          - `gtin` — [GTIN](/openapi/orders-fbs#tag/FBS-Metadata/paths/~1api~1v3~1orders~1%7BorderId%7D~1meta~1gtin/put)
          - `sgtin` — [Data matrix code](/openapi/orders-fbs#tag/FBS-Metadata/paths/~1api~1v3~1orders~1%7BorderId%7D~1meta~1sgtin/put)

          - `customsDeclaration` — [customs declaration number](/openapi/orders-fbs#tag/FBS-Metadata/paths/~1api~1marketplace~1v3~1orders~1%7BorderId%7D~1meta~1customs-declaration/put)

          If any of the metadata objects are not returned in the response, it means that the assembly order cannot have such metadata, and they cannot be added

        **Supplies limitations**:

        - Supplies applicable only for assembly orders in the FBS (Fulfillment by Seller) delivery.
        - All assembly orders added to supply automatically transferred from the `new` status to the `confirm` status.
        - Please note that if you will `cancel` (`Canceled by the seller`) the order, we will automatically remove it from the supply.
        - A supply can only be assembled from assembly jobs (orders) with the same dimensional type (cargoType). A new supply does not have a dimensional attribute. When the first assembly order is added to a supply, the supply acquires the dimensional attribute of that assembly order.
